# TECHATHON

I created this model using the Random Forest Classifier Algorithm, Performed HyperParameter tuning like Randomized Search CV and preprocessing techniques like one hot encoder.
Got an accuracy of 86%.
After which i created a website and connected my deployed model using the flask framework.
Using the joblib package converted my model to joblib file and saved it to connect with the flask.
